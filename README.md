# Documentation about my time as an apprentice

I started working at BAS Kommunikasjon 15 of August 2022.
Until now I have mostly worked with e-mail templates, but thanks to general "geek" talk I have managed to 
get some relevant information about my field.


Until 20 of January 2023 this is what I have been focusing on:

Design:
  Mainly webdesign, but a little e-mail template design as well.
  This is all on my own though.
  
Development:
  E-mail templates:
    I have done a lot of work within this, and have gotten quite a lot of experience in this now. There
    is still things to learn but as this is not a forever expanding field, I think the ceiling for what
    is useful to me might be coming quite soon.
    
  Vanilla webdevelopment:
    I only had experience with this when I started working in this company. My best language as of yet is
    probably Cascading Style Sheets. At the time, I had minimal experience with Javascript, but loads of 
    confidence, which was beaten to dust by observing another talent here. I have recovered since after
    getting some course-work by myself (Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762304#overview)
    
  Vue development:
    I heard about this when I joined the company, and though it wasn't for me, it was a good experience. 
    I plan to continue working on this when I get good at the React framework.
    
  React webapps:
    I didn't even know about React before I joined the company, but now that I have joined I have found the
    concept it presents to be quite nice. I am still at beginner level, yet to actually finish anything and
    also incredibly confused about what to do with this at the moment. I am setting up a project that I plan
    to make in React with 1 API, AXIOS, tailwind CSS, a database and additional React libraries.

  CSS:
    I wanted to mention this seperately, as it covers a bit more than standard css.
    The things I mainly want to learn here is:
      1. SVG
        To write SVG art from the bottom up is something I would like to learn, and something that might be really
        useful in the future.
      2. CSS animation
        I know how to use keyframes, but I would like to expand a bit on this knowledge. And especially learn
        how to combine this with javascript to learn things like parralax and similar animation patterns.
      3. SVG animation
        This is almost a given, but to use the SVG's I get / make in a CSS animation is something I aspire
        to do.
