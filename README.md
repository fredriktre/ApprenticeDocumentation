# Documentation about my time as an apprentice

I started working at BAS Kommunikasjon 15 of August 2022.
Until now I have mostly worked with e-mail templates, but thanks to general "geek" talk I have managed to 
get some relevant information about my field.


Until 20 of January 2023 this is what I have been focusing on:

Design:
  Mainly webdesign, but a little e-mail template design as well.
  This is all on my own though.
  
Development:
  E-mail templates:
    I have done a lot of work within this, and have gotten quite a lot of experience in this now. There
    is still things to learn but as this is not a forever expanding field, I think the ceiling for what
    is useful to me might be coming quite soon.
    
  Vanilla webdevelopment:
    I only had experience with this when I started working in this company. My best language as of yet is
    probably Cascading Style Sheets. At the time, I had minimal experience with Javascript, but loads of 
    confidence, which was beaten to dust by observing another talent here. I have recovered since after
    getting some course-work by myself (Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762304#overview)
    
  Vue development:
    I heard about this when I joined the company, and though it wasn't for me, it was a good experience. 
    I plan to continue working on this when I get good at the React framework.
    
  React webapps:
    I didn't even know about React before I joined the company, but now that I have joined I have found the
    concept it presents to be quite nice. I am still at beginner level, yet to actually finish anything and
    also incredibly confused about what to do with this at the moment. I am setting up a project that I plan
    to make in React with 1 API, AXIOS, tailwind CSS, a database and additional React libraries.

  CSS:
    I wanted to mention this seperately, as it covers a bit more than standard css.
    The things I mainly want to learn here is:
      1. SVG
        To write SVG art from the bottom up is something I would like to learn, and something that might be really
        useful in the future.
      2. CSS animation
        I know how to use keyframes, but I would like to expand a bit on this knowledge. And especially learn
        how to combine this with javascript to learn things like parralax and similar animation patterns.
      3. SVG animation
        This is almost a given, but to use the SVG's I get / make in a CSS animation is something I aspire
        to do.
        
   I am working on point 1 and 2 at the moment, but it will take time as it's not my main priority.
        
       
This is about everything I have learned until now. 

A bit about my goals:

1. I wish to become good enough in design to make medium to high quality webdesigns, webappsdesigns and appsdesigns.
2. I wish to become a good enough web-developer to make medium to high quality React and vanilla websites / webapps
3. I wish to learn how to make mobile apps using React-native and maybe also the native code for android and IOS (that being 2 different languages).
4. I wish to become good enough at web- / app-animation to make high quality animations.

Goals unrelated to my education:

1. Learn c# and how the Unity engine works / Learn Unreal engine and its custom code works.

This was all that I thought about for now, more will come in the future.



22.02.2023

It's been about a month, and I would just like to update a little bit about what I have been trying to learn in this month

  React webapps:
    I have continued on this, making a discord clone that I have almost finished. I am taking a break from it due to a little bit of burnout.
    I will finish it once I have another project I'm doing done.

  React native:
    I took a little look at React native! And it seems really fun, but I was suddenly hit with some internet problems at home so my testing system (expo)
    doesn't work as expected. More work awaits when I get an emulator to fix that problem.

  Tailwind CSS:
    For both the mentioned projects, I used tailwind css. It's a utility class library that makes writing css seem seamless. It's really nice on the head and
    just makes sense. I will very likely continue to use this.
  
  TrevlandSite:
    I have been working on a little site for my father that is taking wayyyy too long due to my own laziness :P
    It's just a site to display some information about people in the family, and I am currently working on the systems that interact with the database.

  Firebase:
    For all mentioned projects, I used Firebase for a backend. For now I have learned a bit about:
      1. Firestore
      2. Authentication
      3. Storage
    
    I will likely continue to use it in the future, until I feel like learning something new.

I want to continue on with doing these things in the future as well. Not that I have forgotten my earlier goals, but being able to make design into code
is something I need to know. 

07.03.2023

It's been about a month, and here is the update:

  I haven't really touched React Native since last month sadly. It's only been about 2 weeks, but still. 
  
  I have expanded my knowledge about tailwindcss and firebase, getting better and better bit by bit.
  
  https://querymessenger.web.app/ just got finished, and it is live! I am actually a bit proud of it even
  if it's simple. It only took about a week to make after all.
  
  I have finished the first version of my family's page. Just need to get it online. I am, however, really
  dissatisfied with the result. So I will redesign and redo the whole page. This time with more functionality and better design.
  
  Other than that, I am looking to make a couple different projects going forward. We will see what happens.
