# Documentation about my time as an apprentice

I started working at BAS Kommunikasjon 15 of August 2022.
Until now I have mostly worked with e-mail templates, but thanks to general "geek" talk I have managed to 
get some relevant information about my field.


Until 20 of January 2023 this is what I have been focusing on:

Design:
  Mainly webdesign, but a little e-mail template design as well.
  This is all on my own though.
  
Development:
  E-mail templates:
    I have done a lot of work within this, and have gotten quite a lot of experience in this now. There
    is still things to learn but as this is not a forever expanding field, I think the ceiling for what
    is useful to me might be coming quite soon.
    
  Vanilla webdevelopment:
    I only had experience with this when I started working in this company. My best language as of yet is
    probably Cascading Style Sheets. At the time, I had minimal experience with Javascript, but loads of 
    confidence, which was beaten to dust by observing another talent here. I have recovered since after
    getting some course-work by myself (Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762304#overview)
    
  Vue development:
    I heard about this when I joined the company, and though it wasn't for me, it was a good experience. 
    I plan to continue working on this when I get good at the React framework.
    
  React webapps:
    I didn't even know about React before I joined the company, but now that I have joined I have found the
    concept it presents to be quite nice. I am still at beginner level, yet to actually finish anything and
    also incredibly confused about what to do with this at the moment. I am setting up a project that I plan
    to make in React with 1 API, AXIOS, tailwind CSS, a database and additional React libraries.

  CSS:
    I wanted to mention this seperately, as it covers a bit more than standard css.
    The things I mainly want to learn here is:
      1. SVG
        To write SVG art from the bottom up is something I would like to learn, and something that might be really
        useful in the future.
      2. CSS animation
        I know how to use keyframes, but I would like to expand a bit on this knowledge. And especially learn
        how to combine this with javascript to learn things like parralax and similar animation patterns.
      3. SVG animation
        This is almost a given, but to use the SVG's I get / make in a CSS animation is something I aspire
        to do.
        
   I am working on point 1 and 2 at the moment, but it will take time as it's not my main priority.
        
       
This is about everything I have learned until now. 

A bit about my goals:

1. I wish to become good enough in design to make medium to high quality webdesigns, webappsdesigns and appsdesigns.
2. I wish to become a good enough web-developer to make medium to high quality React and vanilla websites / webapps
3. I wish to learn how to make mobile apps using React-native and maybe also the native code for android and IOS (that being 2 different languages).
4. I wish to become good enough at web- / app-animation to make high quality animations.

Goals unrelated to my education:

1. Learn c# and how the Unity engine works / Learn Unreal engine and its custom code works.

This was all that I thought about for now, more will come in the future.



22.02.2023

It's been about a month, and I would just like to update a little bit about what I have been trying to learn in this month

  React webapps:
    I have continued on this, making a discord clone that I have almost finished. I am taking a break from it due to a little bit of burnout.
    I will finish it once I have another project I'm doing done.

  React native:
    I took a little look at React native! And it seems really fun, but I was suddenly hit with some internet problems at home so my testing system (expo)
    doesn't work as expected. More work awaits when I get an emulator to fix that problem.

  Tailwind CSS:
    For both the mentioned projects, I used tailwind css. It's a utility class library that makes writing css seem seamless. It's really nice on the head and
    just makes sense. I will very likely continue to use this.
  
  TrevlandSite:
    I have been working on a little site for my father that is taking wayyyy too long due to my own laziness :P
    It's just a site to display some information about people in the family, and I am currently working on the systems that interact with the database.

  Firebase:
    For all mentioned projects, I used Firebase for a backend. For now I have learned a bit about:
      1. Firestore
      2. Authentication
      3. Storage
    
    I will likely continue to use it in the future, until I feel like learning something new.

I want to continue on with doing these things in the future as well. Not that I have forgotten my earlier goals, but being able to make design into code
is something I need to know. 

07.03.2023

It's been about a month, and here is the update:

  I haven't really touched React Native since last month sadly. It's only been about 2 weeks, but still. 
  
  I have expanded my knowledge about tailwindcss and firebase, getting better and better bit by bit.
  
  https://querymessenger.web.app/ just got finished, and it is live! I am actually a bit proud of it even
  if it's simple. It only took about a week to make after all.
  
  I have finished the first version of my family's page. Just need to get it online. I am, however, really
  dissatisfied with the result. So I will redesign and redo the whole page. This time with more functionality and better design.
  
  Other than that, I am looking to make a couple different projects going forward. We will see what happens.


22.03.2023

I have been researching a lot of different possibilites for techstacks.

Currently I have my eyes on
  1. Astro.js
  2. Next.js

Astro is good because of its insane load-times and static generation. Though you can also
use "islands" for interactive components.

I still need to learn a lot more about Astro before I know how all this works. And I know
that Astro isn't the "best" one, but I think it will fit my needs for the imminent future really great.

Next is more of a backend framework from what I understand. It consists of react on the front-end and mainly
typescript on the backend. Then there are things like Trpc and Prisma that can make things there easier.

Other than that, I am really trying to push my coding to the next level. It's hard though, as I have no clue
where I'm going.

I am positive however. I think I will find a path further in the future.


24.04.2023

I feel kind of bad at this point.

I feel like my learning has hit a wall, and that I'm wasting time. I guess a big reason for it is because I'm
bad at setting good goals, so that should probably be something I learn in the future.

for now though, the languages I've worked most with is:
  1. React.js
  2. Astro.js

I have also started to look at Brain.js a bit, it's just for AI but it seems fun.
Chart.js is also coming up.

As for email stuff (what I actually do at my workplace), I have started looking
at a framework called Maizzle. It's essentially React.js for email if I'm gonna explain it quickly.

Found out yesterday when I started a small c# project that the visual part of the .NET winform is actually in
Visual BASIC. So I might be able to say that I can code in that in the future, IF I actually make some projects in it
and such that is...

What I really want to do right now is:
 1. Learn more about React.js's hooks and general stuff (feel like my fundamental React understanding is lacking).
 2. Finish up my fathers Astro.js page. It requires some thinking when it comes to the family tree, and I haven't really been
 doing that, to my own dissapointment...
 3. Start learning Next.js, and learn how to connect that to a SEQUEL (SQL) database, since using NoSQL databases isn't really smart
 for every single project. Each project's got its own needs.
 4. To actually use more of my free time to program. I need to do something about my work ethic and my lack of motivation towards
 anything that could potentially cause any level of frustration. I won't learn if I don't try right?

There is now only 50 days until 13.06.2023. So I don't have many days left before I'm 19. Hopefully this year will be better on me.
